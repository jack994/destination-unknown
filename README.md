## Run the project locally

To run the application a Skyscanner API key is required. A temporary key can be generated on [THIS PAGE](https://skyscanner.github.io/slate/#flights-browse-prices) clicking on `Run in Postman` (The requests imported to postman will contain the temporary key). After obtaining the key, create a `.env` file in the server folder containing `SKYSCANNER_API_KEY=<your_key_here>`.

To run the application follow these steps:

- `npm i`
- `npm run start:client` in one terminal tab/window
- `npm run start:server` in another terminal tab/window
- If it does not open automatically, navigate to [http://localhost:3000]
